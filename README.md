Alan's Linux Setup
=================================
These are scripts and config files for things I most commonly install on a new linux build.  These are not really intended for anyone else to use, but more as a repository I can access from anywhere to conveniently setup a new machine.
Feel free to use them if you like.  They have been not-so-carefully constructed by pieceing together random snippets that I liked, and a several of them have come from http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/
